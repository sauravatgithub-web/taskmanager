# ✅ Task Manager App

This project showcases a sleek and functional **Task Manager Web Application** built using fundamental web technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

It draws inspiration from the Todoist app, incorporating classic design patterns and color schemes to give a professional and real-world feel. While the overall design is adapted, numerous modifications and additions make this project uniquely mine.

Notably, all **icons and graphics** were personally designed using **Canva**, and even the **password hashing logic** was self-written (albeit simple). The codebase is clean, readable, and modular—making it a great base for further development and collaboration.
